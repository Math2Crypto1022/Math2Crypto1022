# Hi, I’m @Math2Crypto1022
 <p> From a phenomonological perspective, it is my belief that the distinction
      between <i>abstractions</i> and the <i>physical world</i> is largely illusory.
</p>      
<p>The purpose of this is to illustrate the relationship between <i>abstractions</i>
      and technology. The line between abstractions and reality has become blurred more than ever due to this growing relationship.

<p>From a technological perspective, I am currently learning: The RSA Digital Signature Scheme, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Data Algorithms, Bitcoin Blockchain technology, Public Key Assymetric Cryptography, and most interestingly... Quantum Computing.
      </p>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, I am learning: All the technical topics above, Jungian Psychology, Chaos Theory, Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, Tibetan Yogas of Dream of Sleep, Carlos Castaneda's Books, Phenomonology, and Radical Empircism.
      </p>
      
I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
