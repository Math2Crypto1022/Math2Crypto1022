- 👋 Hi, I’m @Math2Crypto1022
- 👀 <p> From a phenomonological perspective, it is my belief that the distinction
      between <i>abstractions</i> and the <i>physical world</i> is largely illusory.
      This belief stems from my experience of life, a variety of
      religious and philosophical teachings, and that the application
      of <i>abstractions</i> to computers has changed the reality we occupy, to such
      an extent that, the line between <i>abstraction</i> and <i>reality</i> is
      blurred. </p>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to illustrate  —to the most <i>generally <b>truly</b>
       interested </i> reader
      coming from the widest range of disciplines— the relationship between <i>abstractions</i>
      and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: The RSA Digital Signature Scheme, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Data Algorithms, Bitcoin Blockchain technology, Public Key Assymetric Cryptography.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
